This tool is only visible when the dev mode is activated ([b]Shift + Alt + Z[/b]). Select multiple incomplete buildings and have them [b]instantly completed[/b]. A handy tool when testing or prototyping.

[h3]Pause buildings in the selected range[/h3]
Select multiple buildings that need to be paused. Hold [b]SHIFT[/b] to lock the selection to a specific building type. A useful tool for temporarily stopping groups of buildings during colony micromanagement.

[h2]For the modders: API to create your own tools[/h2]
For the full instructions, read [url=https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/df74039908baf49845fce5b7a7cd87e1b0b37dd2/CustomTools/README.md]README[/url]. 

The game's native approach to creating tools requires a considerable amount of code. If your mod only needs “a button” in the bottom bar, you can use this mod to significantly reduce development effort:
[list]
[*] Create a simple class that inherits from [b]AbstractCustomTool[/b] or one of its descendants.
[*] Create a blueprint that defines the appearance of your button. At minimum, add [b]CustomToolSpec[/b]. You can add additional specs to control behavior or provide extra data to your class.
[*] Use Timberborn’s blueprint patching system to update [b]TemplateCollection[/b]. This allows the [b]CustomTools[/b] mod to recognize your new tool.
[*] (Optional) Create your own group button in the bottom bar and attach your tools to it. See this example blueprint: [b]ToolGroup.CustomTools[/b].

[h3]Tool examples[/h3]
[list]
[*] [b]DebugFinishNowTool[/b]. A basic tool that selects a set of block objects on the map and performs actions on them.
[*] [b]PauseTool[/b]. A more advanced example that uses selection locking to target specific object types.

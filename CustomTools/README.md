This mod offers new quality-of-life tools in the bottom bar and also provides an API for modders to quickly create their own tools.

This tool is only visible when the dev mode is activated (Shift + Alt + Z). Select multiple incomplete buildings and have
them instantly completed. A handy tool when testing or prototyping.

## For the modders: Simplified API to create your own tools

This mod is based on the [`Moddable Groups`](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3612110827) mod.
You can choose to use that mod for the maximum flexibility in configuring tools. However, if your mod only needs “a
button” or a small set of buttons, you can use this mod to set up your tools with minimum coding efforts:

1. Create a simple class that inherits from
   [`AbstractCustomTool`](https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/timberborn-1.0/CustomTools/Tools/AbstractCustomTool.cs)
   or one of its descendants. This class will be serving teh tool functionality.

2. Create a blueprint that defines the appearance of your button:
   * Add [`CustomToolSpec`](https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/8704467e2e08885f47f8b4cce06ed01912e48672/CustomTools/Core/CustomToolSpec.cs)
     and set `GroupId` to the name of the relevant group. The name of the standard _CustomTools_ tool group name is
     "CustomToolsToolGroup", so you can put your tools there. Or you can define your own group (see below).
   * You can add additional specs to then tool blueprint to control behavior or provide extra data to your class. In the
     tool implementation, get extra specs via `ToolSpec.GetSpec<MyExtraSpec>()`.

3. __Optional__. Create your own group button in the bottom bar and attach your tools to it. See this example blueprint:
   [ToolGroup.CustomTools](https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/8704467e2e08885f47f8b4cce06ed01912e48672/CustomTools/Mod/Blueprints/ToolGroups/ToolGroup.CustomTools.blueprint.json).
   * Groups can be nested. Set `CustomGroupSpec.ParentGroupId` to a name of another groups, and it will become a
     subgroup.
   * In subgroups, value of `Layout` is ignored. `Order` is considered together with the tools in the same parent group.
     I.e. the groups and tools can be mixed in any combinations (based on the order).

### Tool examples

* [`DebugFinishNowTool`](https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/timberborn-1.0/CustomTools/Tools/DebugFinishNowTool.cs).
  A basic tool that selects a set of block objects on the map and performs actions on them.
  Its blueprint can be found [here](https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/8704467e2e08885f47f8b4cce06ed01912e48672/CustomTools/Mod/Blueprints/Tools/Tool.CustomTools.DebugFinishNowTool.blueprint.json).

* [`PauseTool`](https://github.com/ihsoft/TimberbornMods/blob/timberborn-1.0/CustomTools/Tools/PauseTool.cs).
  A more advanced example that uses selection locking to target specific object types.
